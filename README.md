# Overview

PDXGEM is a statistical genomics and bioinformatics pipeline to build a multi-gene expression model for predicting responses of cancer patients to anti-cancer therapeutics on the basis of data on mRNA expression profiles and drug-sensitivity of Patient-Derived tumor Xenograft models (PDXs).

Kim et al. (2019) PDXGEM: Patient-Derived Tumor Xenograft based Gene Expression Model for Predicting Clinical Response to Anticancer Therapy in Cancer Patients, bioRxiv 686667; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/686667

In brief, PDXGEM consists of four subsequent analysis steps, 1) in vivo drug senstivity biomarker discovery, 2) Concordant Co-Expression Analysis, 3) Multi-gene drug response prediction model training step, and 4) testing the performance of the prediction model.
